# AI Frameworks ðŸ¤–


## project: setup
- `dataset/input` should contain the training set images collected by the class 
- `dataset/output` should exist to have a location to save the results 
- `lib` contains the modules to run this project
- `models` conatains .onnx or .xml files if the model/algorithm has no URL to which we can download from  


## project: how to run ?
First you must install the required libraries either using the `requirements.txt` or the `pyproject.toml`
```sh
# create a virtual environment either with venv
python -m venv ./venv
# activate the virtual environment
./venv/scripts/activate
# and use pip
pip install -r requirements.txt

# or with uv
uv add -r requirements.txt
```

after you can just modify and run the `main.py` , which is the entrypoint of this application

```sh
# -v for verbose output
python main.py -v 
```
